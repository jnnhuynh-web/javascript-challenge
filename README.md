# javascript-challenge
The UFO dataset provided is in the form of an array of JavaScript objects.
The goal is to write code that appends a table to a web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment.

The JavaScript code will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
